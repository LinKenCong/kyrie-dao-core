## Overview

This project aims to combining a decentralized autonomous organization with the ERC6551 protocol. The DAO will Utilize
the ERC6551 protocol to create a special smart contract account for DAO members. This account will allow flexible
management of DAO assets, bind with DAO's NFT (ERC721), serve as DAO member authentication for governance voting, and
can hold other blockchain digital assets. The project also has the potential for future expansion and additional
functionality.

## Features

- Create a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that restricts governance identity accounts.
- Utilize the ERC6551 protocol to create a smart contract account for flexible management of assets.
- Bind the DAO's NFTs (ERC721) with the ERC6551 accounts.
- The ERC6551 accounts are capable of holding other blockchain digital assets.
- Each member of the DAO has only one vote in governance proposals.
